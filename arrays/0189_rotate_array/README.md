## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
- `0 <= k <= 105`

**Follow up:**

- Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least **three** different ways to solve this problem.
- Could you do it in-place with `O(1)` extra space?

## Approach

To rotate the array to the right by `k` positions, we use the
reversal algorithm.

For example:

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
k = 3

The expected result is:

[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Instead of shifting the elements one by one, we perform three
reversals.

1. First, calculate the actual number of rotations using:

   `k = k % n`

   This is necessary because rotating an array `n` times gives the
   original array.

2. Reverse the entire array:

   `[7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`

3. Reverse the first `k` elements:

   `[5, 6, 7, 4, 3, 2, 1]`

4. Reverse the remaining elements:

   `[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

The array is now rotated to the right by `k` positions.

The important idea is that reversing the whole array brings the
elements that need to move to the front, and the next two reversals
restore their internal order.
